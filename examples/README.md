# Examples

## Introduction
The `examples` directory provides standalone example programs expressing the
various APIs as well as a simple use-case using HElib. The example programs
provided currently only use the BGV scheme.

## What is provided
Currently the examples provided comprise:
- BGV_binary_arithmetic
- BGV_country_db_lookup
- BGV_packed_arithmetic

More examples are expected to be released at a later date.

## Installation
To compile the examples, you must have HElib already installed on your system 
(see [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) in this distribution's root directory). The
process is pure CMake. First, create a build directory and move into it.
From `examples/build` run CMake,

```
cmake [-Dhelib_DIR=<directory-to-installed-HElib>/share/cmake/helib] <directory-to-examples> ..
```

then run make from the same directory with optional number of threads using the
`-j` flag for example,

```
make [-j<number-of-threads>]
```

The executables for each of the example programs can be found in the `bin`
directory.

## Running the examples

All examples have a help method by passing the `-h` flag, for example

```
./BGV_packed_arithmetic -h
```

The BGV_packed_arithmetic example shows some of the basic arithmetic APIs
available for ciphertext and plaintext objects.

The BGV_binary_arithmetic example shows the API for performing binary
arithmetic on a vector of ciphertexts where i-th ciphertext contains the i-th
bit of the binary number.

The BGV_country_db_lookup example shows a use-case for performing a database
lookup on countries and their capitals, more information on this can be found
[here](BGV_country_db_lookup/README.md).

## Running the tests

All tests for the examples are written in bats (a test framework for bash)
and requires [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core).

Note that the tests require that the examples have been successfully compiled
in the `build` directory and available in `build/bin`. To run the tests, one
can simply execute the scripts from within the `examples/tests` directory.

To run all tests type the command below. Optionally, the `-j` flag can use
threads to parallelize the tests. Note, this requires GNU parallel, see the
[bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) documentation for more
information. 
```
bats . [-j <number-of-threads>]
```
To run a specific test file. 
```
bats <testfile> [-j <number-of-threads>]
```
or 
```
./<testfile> [-j <number-of-threads>]
```
To run a specific test by name add the `-f` flag e.g.
```
bats . -f <testname> [-j <number-of-threads>]
```

The `<testname>` can be a substring of the test name and will match all valid
matches.

For debugging, it is sometimes useful to view the artifacts generated by the
tests. For this, set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `true` or `1` such as,
```
DEBUG=1 bats . [-j <number-of-threads>]
```
